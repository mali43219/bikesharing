Purpose:
The aim of the project is to assist Kate in persuading investors that establishing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a viable business plan. In order to convince the proposal, the stakeholder requires a bicycle trip analysis. Despite the data being from August in NYC, the analysis will demonstrate that the proposal is a worthwhile endeavor, based on the situation in New York.

Summary: This analysis effectively presents all the essential elements of operating a bike-sharing business, including the various user types, usage patterns, and optimal maintenance schedules that won't disrupt users. Nevertheless, this analysis may not be applicable to Des Moines since New York City's larger population directly correlates with the demand for a bike-sharing program.
